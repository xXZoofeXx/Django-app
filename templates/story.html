                sometimes we are unsure about how to get the right word. To crack the code for the UX
                copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma plugin for the larger design community.
                The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized
                with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to
                build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, Designing voice and tone for
                error messages.</p>
